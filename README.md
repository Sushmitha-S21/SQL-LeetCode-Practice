# SQL Leetcode Practice Questions

Welcome to my **SQL Leetcode Practice Questions** repository! It is the place where we learn and grow together. Here I will solve the SQL Leetcode questions and post them here with my understanding of the query I wrote for the questions. 

---

## **My Objective **
This repository is built to maintain consistency of learning and upskilling myself in SQL. I will try to solve the questions from Leetcode and Hacker Rank.

## **Topics I am trying to cover**

1.   - SELECT queries
     - JOIN operations
     - GROUP BY and aggregate functions
     - Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
     - Window functions

2. **Well-Documented Solutions**:
   - Each question includes:
     - Problem description
     - SQL solution
     - Explanation of the approachâ€” (because I feel understanding beats memorization)

## **Topics Covered**
- Data Retrieval and Manipulation
- Joins and Relationships
- Aggregations and Grouping
- Subqueries and Nested Queries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Advanced Functions (e.g., Window Functions)
- Performance Optimization

## **Current Plans**
- Try and Solve as many as problems possible with optimised codes.
- Expand my skills and become a better person everyday.
