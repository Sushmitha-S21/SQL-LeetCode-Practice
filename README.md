# SQL Leetcode Practice Questions

Welcome to my **SQL Leetcode Practice Questions** repository! It is the place where we learn and grow together. Here I will solve the SQL Leetcode questions and post them here with my understanding of the query I wrote for the questions. 

---

## **My Objective **
This repository is built to maintain consistency of learning and upskilling myself in SQL. I will try to solve the questions from Leetcode and Hacker Rank. 

---

## **Topics I am trying to cover**

1.   - SELECT queries
     - JOIN operations
     - GROUP BY and aggregate functions
     - Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
     - Window functions

2. **Well-Documented Solutions**:
   - Each question includes:
     - Problem description
     - SQL solution
     - Explanation of the approachâ€” (because I feel understanding beats memorization)

## **How to Use This Repository**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/SQL-Leetcode-Practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant difficulty or topic folder to explore questions and solutions.
3. Check out the SQL scripts and their explanationsâ€”they're designed to make your life easier.
4. Test queries in your local database or online SQL editors like [Leetcode SQL Playground](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/).
